# ArkanoidEOT
A personal implementation of Arkanoid. Developed for the end of term exam of my academic course of Graphics Programming.

## Gameplay

The goal of this game is to destroy all bricks in the level before the ball touches the ground
under the paddle.
There are 3 different levels loaded randomly: one composed only by red bricks(base), one with red and yellow
bricks (normal) and the last one with blue and yellow(hard).

##Input

Paddle:

* Use **Left Arrow** or **Right Arrow** to respectively move the paddle to the left and to the right
* Use **Space Bar** to launch the ball at the beginning of a new match.
**NOTE**: To add some angle to the launched ball move the paddle before pressing the space bar.
  
## Future Improvement

* Add power up for the player: like temporary duplicated balls, temporary larger paddle..
* Add a score and a high score to save
* Add a timer
